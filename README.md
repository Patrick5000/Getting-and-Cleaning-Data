Repo for the submission of the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course.

## Overview

This project serves to demonstrate the collection and cleaning of a tidy data set that can be used for subsequent analysis. A full description of the data used in this project can be found at The UCI Machine Learning Repository



## Some remarks on the script

On line 5 of the script we define the path to the working directory with location of the source files.
After unzipping the source files, we make a few modifications to the R file before we process the data. 

## Project Summary

The following is a summary description of the project instructions

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
* 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
* 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data 
set
* 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
* 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Additional Information

You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
